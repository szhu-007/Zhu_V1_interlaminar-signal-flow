./Figure 2/bo_modulation_index.m plot boder ownership modulation index, for each recording session, the histogram and scatter plot of individual neuron against its recorded cortical depth.

./Figure 3/CCG calculation is the function used to compute the firing-rate normalized and jitter corrected CCGs for each neuronal pair in each recording session, during CRF(grating,ori) and nCRF (border ownership) stimulation conditions. 

./Figure 4/CCG_CRF_vs_nCRF.m is the key comparison used in Figure 3D and Figure 4, to compare the interlaminar CCG asymmetry shift between CRF and nCRF stimulation conditions.

./Figure 5/CCG_asym_vs_bo.m is used in Figure 5, to demonstrate the dependence of nCRF modulation on interlaminar signal flow.
